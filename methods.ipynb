    "# **4. Methods & Plan**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To address my specific question, I will use a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) classification model. K-NN is an appropriate choice because my response variable, **subscribe**, is binary (TRUE/FALSE), and K-NN naturally handles categorical classification outcomes. My explanatory variables (**played_hours**, **Age**, and **experience**) consist of numeric and categorical predictors that can be easily incorporated into a K-NN framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is K-NN the right choice?\n",
    "* K-NN is specifically designed to classify observations into categories such as subscribers vs. non-subscribers\n",
    "* K-NN does not assume linear relationships between the predictors and the response, so it is more flexible when modelling human behaviour like playing habits\n",
    "* It is intuitive, K-NN predicts a player's subscripton status based on similar players\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "* For K-NN to work, the variables must be scaled appropriately because it assumes that similarity in predictors reflect similarity in the outcome\n",
    "* K-NN also depends heavily on the distribution of the data, so the training data must have enough observations for all experience levels and subscription status\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential limitations\n",
    "* Variables measured on diffeent scales can easily distort distances, so needs to be standardised\n",
    "* Results can vary depending on the value of k chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparing & selecting the model\n",
    "I will evaluate the model using cross-validation to compare the classification accuracy (and maybe the precision or recall) across different values of k\n",
    "\n",
    "Some specific measures may include:\n",
    "* Using a 5-fold or 10-fold cross validation to get stable performance estimates\n",
    "* tuning the k parameter over a grid (i.e., k = 1 to 25\n",
    "* the value of k that produces the highest average accuracy across the folds will be used for the final model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing the data to apply model\n",
    "1. Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because K-NN relies on distances, I will scale numeric predictors (Age and played_hours) based only on the training data, then apply the same scaling parameters to the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Splitting the data\n",
    "* I will split the data after all minimal wrangling/scaling using only the training data. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Planned split will look like the following to provide a good balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: 80% <br>\n",
    "Testing set: 20%\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross-Validation\n",
    "With the training set only:\n",
    "* perform a 5-fold cross validation\n",
    "* tune k\n",
    "* choose the best model\n",
    "* evaluate the final performance on untouched test set\n",
    "\n",
    "A  validation set is not needed because cross-validation in the training set will take care of the model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Final model evaluation\n",
    "   \n",
    "Once the best model is chosen by cross-validation, I will:\n",
    "* Fit the model to the full training set\n",
    "* Evaluate the accuracy on the separate 20% test set\n",
